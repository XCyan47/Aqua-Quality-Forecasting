- The LSTM model achieves moderate predictive performance with an R of 0.6675, explaining 66.8% of the variance in the data.


CONCLUSION
----------
The comparative analysis clearly demonstrates that LSTM models provide superior forecasting performance
for water quality parameters compared to traditional ARIMA models. The improvement is most pronounced
for temperature and dissolved oxygen predictions, where the LSTM model achieves both high accuracy
(low RMSE) and excellent explanatory power (high R).

While ARIMA models provide a solid baseline and are computationally less demanding, the significant
performance improvements offered by LSTM models justify their adoption for water quality forecasting
applications where high accuracy is required.
